School,Description
Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital,"TASH started providing service to the whole country since 1966 as a memori- al of Prince Mekonnen, the Duke of Harar. In 1998, the largest referral hospi- tal in the country, with 850 beds, was transferred to the School of Medicine by the Federal Ministry of Health, and it has since become the University teaching hospital. The TASH is now the main teaching hospital for both clinical and preclinical training of most disciplines. It is also an institution where specialized clinical services that are not available in other public or private institutions are rendered to the whole nation. The TASH annually serves about half a million patients in the outpatient de- partment; 50,000 patients in the inpatient department and 40,000 patients in the emergency department.  "
School of Public Health,"The Department of Community Health was founded in 1964 under the Medical Faculty with the objective of training and equipping medical doctors with public health thinking and practice useful for a developing country setting where the majority of the morbidities and mortalities are preventable and most people are living in rural areas with no or little access to health services.
It has pioneered to start the first graduate training in public health at a master’s level (MPH) in Ethiopia in 1984 and the doctoral program (PhD) in 2003/2004. The SPH is organized into two departments; the Department of Reproductive Health and Health Service Management and the Department of Preventive Medicine. Currently, the School runs six programs."
School of Nursing and Midwifery,"The School of nursing and midwifery comprises two academic departments, which are namely, the Department of Nursing and Midwifery and the Department of Medical Laboratory Sciences. Until May 2012, they were managed by the Faculty of Medicine. These two Schools were brought together as two departments to be managed under the College of Health Sciences of Addis Ababa University following the recent structural reform of Addis Ababa University."
School of Medicine,"The School of Medicine (SoM) was established in 1964 with the goal of produc- ing medical doctors to shoulder the country’s health problems. In 1998, the Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital, the largest referral hospital in the country with over 850 bed has become the University teaching hospital. Currently, the academic programs consist of 4 undergraduate programs, 9 MSc,7 PhD, 20 Spe- cialty and 34 Sub-specialty/fellowship programs."
School of Pharmacy,"The School of Pharmacy (SoP) was established in September 1961 as a unit un- der the Faculty of Science of the then Haile-Selassie I University with the goal of producing pharmacists to handle the country’s pharmaceutical and health needs. Two years later, it was merged with the newly opened Institute of Medical Sciences to form the Faculty of Medicine. Later on, in 1978, the Department of Pharmacy was raised to a full-fledged Faculty status under the name of “School of Pharmacy”. "
